Final assignment of the Games Concepts module in year 1 (2018/2019). Made with TL Engine and C++. 
Level file was created using a slapdash level maker. It did the job well but it's a mess so that won't be shared here. 

Controls:
  WASD - move
  Space - boost
  Arrows - move camera
  123 - switch between camera modes/reset camera position and orientation
  
If the project doesn't start, it can be easily recreated by making a new project with TL Engine (http://gamesnorthwest.net/resources/tl_engine/downloads.html), replacing the cpp file's contents and putting the media folder and the level.txt file inside that new project. The project solution might also need to be retargetted to version 10.0.17134.0 of the Windows SDK.
